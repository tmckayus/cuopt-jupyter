# cuOpt Self-Hosted Service in Jupyter

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that will install the cuOpt service and example notebooks. The notebook will:

* Install necessary dependencies on the Jupyter host
* Install cuOpt example notebooks from github/NVIDIA/cuopt-examples in the **examples** directory
  * A separate license included in the **examples** directory applies to content from the github/NVIDIA/cuopt-examples repository
* Download the cuOpt container from NVIDIA NGC

Once installed, the cuOpt service may be started and stopped as needed from the notebook.
