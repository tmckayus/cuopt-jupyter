# cuOpt in Jupyter

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that will install any missing libraries needed by cuOpt on the Jupyter host
and download additional notebooks from github.com/NVIDIA/cuopt-examples.

It is designed for use with a NVIDIA Brev Launchable, but may be used on other platforms as well.
