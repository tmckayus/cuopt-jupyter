# cuOpt Self-Hosted Service in Jupyter

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that outline how the cuOpt self-hosted service can be used to solve a wide variety of problems.

These notebooks use the standard cuopt-sh client which will work with Python 3.10+. Additionally, an **install.ipynb** notebook is included which downloads and runs the cuOpt container image on the Jupyter server host (requires sudo privileges by the user running the notebook and an api-key that has access to the cuOpt container).

## Summary

- **install.ipynb :** A notebook that downloads the cuOpt container image using your NGC api-key and starts the container on your host. Requires previous authorization for the cuOpt container and sudo privileges on the Jupyter host.

Each notebook below represents an example use case for NVIDIA cuOpt. All notebooks demonstrate high level problem modeling leveraging the cuOpt self hosted service.  In addition, each notebook covers additional cuOpt features listed below alongside notebook descriptions

- **cost_matrix_creation.ipynb :** A notebook demonstrating how to build a cost matrix for various problem types
    - *Additional Features:* 
        - WaypointMatrix
