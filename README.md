# cuOpt Self-Hosted Service in Jupyter

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that will bootstrap a self-hosted environment for cuOpt. The notebook will:

* Install necessary dependencies on the Jupyter host
* Install cuOpt example notebooks from the cuOpt-Resources repository on github
* Download the cuOpt container from NVIDIA NGC

Once installed, the cuOpt service may be started and stopped as needed from the notebook.
